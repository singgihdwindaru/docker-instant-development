# Docker Instant Development

Docker Instant Development demonstrates real-time development using Docker containers. By seamlessly connecting your local path to a Docker container, you can develop without the hassle of rebuilding Docker images for every code change. This accelerates development within an isolated Docker environment, ensuring consistent performance across local, development, testing, and production environments.

## Key Benefits:

- **Elimination of "It Works on My Machine" Issues**: Docker containers eliminate discrepancies between development and production environments, solving the common problem of "it works on my local machine".

- **Increased Productivity**: Docker enables seamless integration of your local development environment with containerized applications, leading to faster iteration cycles and reduced deployment friction.

- **Increased Confidence in Deployments**: Docker's reproducible environment increase confidence in deployments, ensuring your application behaves consistently throughout development and deployment stages.
